Python code lines end on the line, there is no use of semicolons to denote the end of a line

Indentation acts as {} would in other languages like C or Java
They denote blocks of code
The number of spaces must be consistent
Examples:
if x > 2:
    print("")

Variables are created when you assign a value, and much like JavaScript you do not
use define the types
Examples:
    int x = 2 # Wrong
    x # Wrong, there must be data assigned
    x = 2 # Correct
