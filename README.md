# Python 101
A collection of notes for Python

### Syntax 
Python code lines end on the line, there is no use of semicolons to denote the end of a line

Indentation acts as `{}` would in other languages like C or Java
They denote blocks of code
The number of spaces must be consistent
Examples:
```
if x > 2:
    print("")
```

Comments are created using the `#` symbol

Variables are created when you assign a value, and much like JavaScript you do not define the types
Examples:
```
int x = 2 # Wrong
x # Wrong, there must be data assigned
x = 2 # Correct
```
